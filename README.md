# React-Interview-Questions

Certainly! Here are all the points at a glance:

# 1. Initialization: 
React applications are initialized using ReactDOM.render() to render the root component into the actual DOM.

# 2.Component Rendering:
React creates a virtual DOM, a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM, for efficient updates.

# 3.Reconciliation: 
When state or props change, React performs reconciliation, comparing virtual DOMs to update the actual DOM efficiently.

# 4.Rendering:
After reconciliation, React applies necessary changes to the actual DOM for efficient updates.

# 5.Lifecycle Methods:
Components have lifecycle methods that are invoked at different stages of their existence, allowing developers to run code during specific points.

# 6.Event Handling:
React provides a simple way to handle user interactions and events with event handlers.

# 7.State Management (Optional): 
For complex applications, external state management libraries like Redux or React's Context API can be used for managing global application state.

# 8.Cleanup and Unmounting:
React invokes cleanup processes when components are unmounted, preventing memory leaks.

# 9.Performance Optimization:
React offers ways to optimize performance, like shouldComponentUpdate or React.memo, reducing unnecessary re-renders.

# 10.Build and Deployment: 
After development, the application is bundled and optimized for production using tools like Webpack and deployed to a web server or hosting platform.
